/*
* Symbolic links, also known as symlinks or soft links, are similar to hard links in that
* both point at files in the filesystem. The symbolic link differs, however, in that it is
* not merely an additional directory entry, but a special type of file altogether. This
* special file contains the pathname for a different file, called the symbolic linkâ€™s target.
* The system call for creating a symbolic link is very similar to its hard link cousin:
* #include <unistd.h>
* int symlink (const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
* A successful call to symlink( ) creates the symbolic link newpath pointing at the tar-
* get oldpath, and then returns 0.
