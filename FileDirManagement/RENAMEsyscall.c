/*
* Unlike for copying, Unix does provide a system call for moving files. The ANSI C
* standard introduced the call for files, and POSIX standardized it for both files and directories:

* #include <stdio.h>
* int rename (const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);

* A successful call to rename( ) renames the pathname oldpath to newpath. The fileâ€™s
* contents and inode remain the same. Both oldpath and newpath must reside on the
* same filesystem*; if they do not, the call will fail. Utilities such as mv must handle this
* case by resorting to a copy and unlink.
