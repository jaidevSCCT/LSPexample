==========

System programming is the practice of writing system software, which is a code that lives at a low level, talking directly to the kernel and core system libraries.

The entire example here which is chapter wise are tested and verified on GNU GCC compiler with Linux 2.6 and above kernel and also in Raspberry pi Rev B. Almost every program will work on any compiler, feel free to share and copy the source code and execute on your machine
Most of the codes are compiled by “gcc –Wall filename.c –o executable-name”.
